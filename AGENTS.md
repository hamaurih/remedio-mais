# Project instructions

## UI standard: shadcn/ui

These rules apply to every frontend or interface change in this repository.

### Required discovery before implementation

1. Read `components.json`, `package.json`, the global CSS file, and the existing `components/ui` directory.
2. Detect the project's package manager, framework, Tailwind version, shadcn style/base, icon library, aliases, and installed components. Do not assume defaults.
3. Before creating custom UI, search in this order:
   - existing local components;
   - the official shadcn/ui registry;
   - configured registries in `components.json`.
4. Use the project's package manager for the current shadcn CLI:
   - npm: `npx shadcn@latest ...`;
   - pnpm: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest ...`;
   - Bun: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest ...`.
5. With that runner, always inspect `info`; search with `search @shadcn -q "<need>"`; load documentation with `docs <component>`; and preview source with `view @shadcn/<component>` before implementing.
6. Prefer composing existing primitives and blocks over creating parallel bespoke components. Create custom UI only when the registries do not provide an adequate base.

### Safe adoption and updates

- Do not clone, vendor, or add the entire `shadcn-ui/ui` repository as a dependency or submodule.
- Add only the components required by the feature.
- Never overwrite an installed component blindly. First use `--dry-run` and `--diff`, then merge upstream changes while preserving local behavior and design.
- Do not use `--overwrite` unless the user explicitly authorizes it.
- Preserve the current framework, Tailwind version, shadcn base/style, aliases, icon library, CSS variables, routes, and Lovable-compatible structure unless a migration is explicitly requested.
- A UI task does not authorize changes to business logic, authentication, RLS, tenant isolation, database schema, API contracts, payments, secrets, or deployment configuration.
- Keep patches incremental and keep the connected branch buildable. Never rewrite published Git history.

### Composition and quality

- Use semantic theme tokens instead of arbitrary foundational colors.
- Reuse shadcn primitives for buttons, fields, cards, tables, dialogs, sheets, alerts, badges, skeletons, empty states, and destructive confirmations.
- Preserve accessibility requirements: labels, keyboard operation, focus states, titles for dialogs/sheets, and ARIA validation states.
- Design loading, empty, error, success, disabled, and mobile states—not only the happy path.
- Match the product's own brand. shadcn is the component foundation, not a reason to make different products visually identical.
- After changes, run the relevant lint, typecheck, tests, and build scripts available in `package.json`.
- Report which registry items were reused, which files changed, and any remaining migration risk.
